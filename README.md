A small game I created in SDL for a University project. For more details go to [www.lewis-ward.com/tug-of-war](http://www.lewis-ward.com/tug-of-war.html)

### Game instructions ###

Objective : Destroy enemy base


* Move your mouse to the left of the screen to move left, move mouse to the right of the screen to move right. 
* When the build buttons are lit you can build new units (left mouse button), units cost gold to build. 
* You will slowly gain gold over time, you gain gold quicker by killing enemy units. Units will move and attack by themselves. 
* Your current gold is shown in the console and is updated every time a unit is killed or built. 
* Bases will show their health in the console when they are at 75%, 50% and 25% health.

This can be accessed in-game via the main menu.

You will need to be able to see both the game window and the console, sometimes the console will appear behind the window.

### How do I get set up? ###

Some Visual Studio files have been included in the project, run "TugOfWarGame.sln", you can build the project in either Debug or Release (Win32) and after the code has been compiled you should be all set up.
